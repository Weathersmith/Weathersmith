- 👋 Hi, I’m @Weathersmith
- 👀 I’m interested in meteorology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning meteorology through Mississippi State University. Specifically through their online BOMP program
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools for weather forecasting. I know stuff like METpy exists and I intend to educate myself on that thoroughly, but I seek to build more.
- 📫 How to reach me: wxwhiskeyxray@gmail.com
- I will update this readme file as I see fit in the future
